# Overview

## Spacing

Equal to the computed value of `font-size` on the root element. When specified on the `font-size` property of the root element, the `rem` units refer to the propertyâ€™s initial value.

This means that `1rem` equals the font size of the `html` element (which for most browsers has a default value of 16px).

`em` units are relative to the font size of their own element.

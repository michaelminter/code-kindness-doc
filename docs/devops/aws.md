## Security

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)

> With AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS, centrally manage fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.

![AWS IAM](../assets/images/aws-iam.png)

Defines the controls and polices that are used to manage access to AWS Resources. Using IAM you can create users and groups and define permissions to various DevOps services.

In addition to the users, various services may also need access to AWS resources. For example, your CodeBuild project might need access to store Docker images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and need permissions to write to Amazon ECR. These types of permissions are defined by a special type role know as service role.

IAM is one component of the AWS security infrastructure. With IAM, you can centrally manage groups, users, service roles and security credentials such as passwords, access keys, and permissions policies that control which AWS services and resources users can access. IAM Policy lets you define the set of permissions. This policy can then be attached to either a Role, User, or a Service to define their permission. You can also use IAM to create roles that are used widely within your desired DevOps strategy. In some cases, it can make perfect sense to programmatically AssumeRole instead of directly getting the permissions. When a service or user assumes roles, they are given temporary credentials to access a service that you normally donâ€™t have access.

#### Policies
A policy is a collection of permissions for a specified services. For example you could have a policy that only allows some users to view the ECS tasks, but allows other users to run them.

Policies can be attached to Groups or directly to individual IAM users.

#### Groups
Groups are what they sound like: groups of users that share access policies. When you add a policy to a group, all of the members of that group acquire the permissions in the policy.

# Security

### IAM

Through identity and access management (IAM), it is possible to assign policies that determine whether a user and the role can access particular services or not. An IAM system is also supposed to maintain the principle of least privilege (POLP), which grants the roles and users the permission to access certain resources. As a business focuses on ensuring the IAM is secure, some of the issues that come about include experimenting using new forms of technology, building fast and reducing friction across teams.

Below are the best IAM practices for DevOps:

Use Strong Passwords

The majority of the users will opt for an easy password. In such an instance, a hacker can easily gain access with minimal effort. Users should create passwords that are highly secure by adhering to the following measures:

The password should have 14 characters or more.
Include one uppercase alphabet, one special character and non-alphabet characters.
Avoid reusing the same password.
Don’t use dictionary words.
Utilize password-generation tolls.
Use Third-party Tools to Enhance Security

For better results, it is advisable to look beyond the service. For example, tools are available that can automate the creation of the IAM policies, making it possible to save a considerable amount of administration time. However, such tools help to eliminate risks while accelerating different management tasks. The administrators should monitor them since they lack flexibility. Update such tools regularly to ensure they are always useful.

IAM Permissions Review Using Access Levels

The IAM policies should be reviewed and monitored to ensure efficient security. Such policies grant access to permissions needed to execute certain actions as per particular requirements. Policy summary can help to review policies that issue details regarding access level for specific services. The access levels include read, list, permission management, tagging and write.

Use Multifactor Authentication

IAM users should have access to multifactor authentication, which ensures response generation on the user’s device, part of the authentication process. To sign in, the user requires the response generated on the device and the right credentials. If the password is compromised, the account’s resources will be secure because of multifactor authentication.

The response can be developed in the following manner:

A code is generated using U2F keys after tapping on the device.
For hardware devices, the response code is generated on the device. You’ll key in the code during the sign-in process.
Get Rid of Unnecessary Credentials

A good security practice should audit the user credentials regularly and get rid of the users who are not active. Credential reports help keep track of the access keys and the password’s life cycle. The report includes the date of creation, user details and when a password was last used or changed. If you’re using a password-rotation policy, you’ll receive a reminder that you should change your password. The auditor can download the credential report and perform additional tasks as per the requirements.

Rotate Credentials Regularly

Change access keys and passwords regularly for all IAM users and place a password policy in place. Also, IAM users should be enlightened about how frequently they should change the passwords.

Never Share Your Account Credentials

Avoid sharing your credentials. If anyone needs to access certain resources, you can create IAM users for them. In such an instance, you can assign permissions to different users.

Monitor User Activities

Organizations should monitor the activities of all the users to get a better view of cloud activities. By doing so, it will be possible to find any threats. A cloud access security broker (CASB) can provide cross-cloud visibility meant to monitor user activity and offer threat protection.

Create a Strategic Plan for IAM

After compiling identities and mapping the access points, you should decide the permissions to keep and change. Every organization should determine its priorities and liaise with the stakeholders while formulating a strategic plan regarding IAM. Put in place a common decision-making framework.

Most firms usually start with privileged accounts. Since such accounts belong to the administrators, they are considered high-value targets for hackers.

An account that has unnecessary access privileges is termed as a security liability. The risks are high if such an account can gain access to sensitive pieces of information. It is always good to determine who has access to the database or different applications.

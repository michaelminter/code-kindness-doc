## Virtualization

Docker is an open source containerization platform. Provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.

Docker enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components that combine application source code with all the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run the code in any environment.

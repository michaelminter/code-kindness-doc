## Agile Software Development

The Agile methodology is a collection of principles that value **adaptability** and **flexibility**. Agile aims to provide better responsiveness to changing business needs and therefore focuses on enabling teams to deliver in workable increments.

#### Pillars

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
    * Tools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
    * Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
    * A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.
    * A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders' priorities, and people's understanding of the problem and its solution.

While both sides have value and the items on the right should be considered, the authors felt that the items on the left should have more influence on how people approach their work.

#### Principles
The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:

* Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
* Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
* Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
* Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
* Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

#### Stages
It contains six phases: concept, inception, iteration, release, maintenance, and retirement. The Agile life cycle will vary slightly depending on the project management methodology chosen by a team.

#### Requirements
Agile requirements, such as functions, services and features, are the key elements a product needs to include to be successful. Teams may develop agile requirements as business rules, functions or constraints to guide them through the production process.

# Project Management

## Agile Development
Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

## Scrum
is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. ... The three pillars of Scrum are transparency, inspection and adaptation.

## Continuous Integration
is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

## Continuous Delivery
is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

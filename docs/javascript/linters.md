# Linters

## ESLint
ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available that analyse specific code styles. One of the most 
common for React is an npm package called `eslint-plugin-react`. By default, it will check a number of best practices, 
with rules checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop types.
